# Microvessel-Density-Analysis

Written in ImageJ macro language, these macros run on directories containing confocal multi-tiff image stacks. Image classification depends on classifiers that are too large to be saved here. They are available upon request and must be saved in the parent directory of the image-containing folder

Run Schager Save ROIs for vessel density plugin.ijm on the folder containing images before running Schager_v6 Vessel Density Plugin.ijm. Then if interested in the variability of vessel density within images, run Schager Subsection Density Analysis.ijm on the output folder from the Vessel Density Plugin.
